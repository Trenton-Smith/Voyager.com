# Voyager

Voyager.com is an interactive photo-sharing web application which allows users to create accounts, save photos, make comments, and search for specific photos. It was developed for a second-year Web Coding class at SFSU.

Due to the database no longer having access, the application can no longer perform the above actions; however, the HTML, CSS, and Javascript were and still are operational pieces of code and can be looked at for reference.
